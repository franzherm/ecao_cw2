This repository contains the project for evolutionary computation and optimisation featuring a particle swarm optimisation algorithm for the knights covering problem.
It features an implementation for the PSO as well as for Stochastic Hillclimb and Random Search.
The aim of this project is to analyse the effect of an inertia update strategy as well as an alternative search space representation when solving the knights covering problem using particle swarm optimisation.
It is based on the results of the paper: N. Franken and A. P. Engelbrecht, "Investigating binary PSO parameter influence on the knights cover problem," 2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, Edinburgh, UK, 2005, pp. 282-289 Vol.1, doi: 10.1109/CEC.2005.1554696.

To run the experiments, execute the cells in **notebook.ipynb**. If you only want to view the results I obtained, run only the cells under the **Result Visualisation** section.
